        <p><a href="https://jensawesomecode.itch.io/dont-drown" target="_blank">Description: Underwater maze, survival, action, adventure, puzzle, game jam, time-based challenge.</a></p>
        <p>Okay, so picture this: You’re deep underwater, totally lost in these twisty, shadowy caves, and your oxygen? Yeah, it’s running out. Fast. <strong>Don’t Drown</strong> is all about staying cool under pressure—literally. You’ve got to snatch bubbles from coral, figure out the maze, and find your way out before time (and air) runs out. No pressure, right?</p>
        <p>During my first Unity game jam in January 2025, I built a custom 3D character controller in C# from scratch, despite having almost no prior Unity experience. The controller featured realistic physics-based movement, including walking, jumping, and momentum handling using Rigidbody components and Unity’s physics engine. I implemented grounded checks, smoothed directional input, and adjusted drag, friction, and force values to make movement feel responsive and natural. When unexpected behaviors occurred (like sliding or input lag), I used debug logs and iterative testing to isolate issues in my code, trace problems to specific methods, and refine interactions for consistency and playability.</p>
        <p>This was a <strong>wild</strong> ride to make. We built the whole thing in just 48 hours during a game jam—pure chaos, fueled by caffeine and questionable decision-making. Our team? Absolute legends. Colin Witow’s the seasoned pro (12 jams under his belt), while the rest of us—Russell Nadin, David Kingdavong, and me, Jen Barrett—jumped into our very first jam with zero hesitation and **a lot** of enthusiasm. Somehow, we pulled off this adrenaline-fueled underwater adventure, and we are **so** proud of it.</p>
        <p>It’s part puzzle, part survival, all heart-pounding action. Ready to see if you can make it out alive?</p>
        <p>Go on. Dive in.</p>
