        <p>Okay, so picture this: You’re deep underwater, totally lost in these twisty, shadowy caves, and your oxygen? Yeah, it’s running out. Fast. <strong>Don’t Drown</strong> is all about staying cool under pressure—literally. You’ve got to snatch bubbles from coral, figure out the maze, and find your way out before time (and air) runs out. No pressure, right?</p>
        <p>During my first Unity game jam in January 2025, I built a custom 3D character controller in C# from scratch, despite having almost no prior Unity experience. The controller featured realistic physics-based movement, including walking, jumping, and momentum handling using Rigidbody components and Unity’s physics engine. I implemented grounded checks, smoothed directional input, and adjusted drag, friction, and force values to make movement feel responsive and natural. When unexpected behaviors occurred (like sliding or input lag), I used debug logs and iterative testing to isolate issues in my code, trace problems to specific methods, and refine interactions for consistency and playability.</p>
        <p>This was a <strong>wild</strong> ride to make. We built the whole thing in just 48 hours during a game jam—pure chaos, fueled by caffeine and questionable decision-making. Our team? Absolute legends. Colin Witow’s the seasoned pro (12 jams under his belt), while the rest of us—Russell Nadin, David Kingdavong, and me, Jen Barrett—jumped into our very first jam with zero hesitation and **a lot** of enthusiasm. Somehow, we pulled off this adrenaline-fueled underwater adventure, and we are **so** proud of it.</p>
        <p>It’s part puzzle, part survival, all heart-pounding action. Ready to see if you can make it out alive?</p>
        <p>Go on. Dive in.</p>

        <p>This website is an archive of my campaign. All graphics are mine.</p>
                <p>I ran for public school board trustee in Saskatoon’s Ward 1 during the 2024 municipal election. My campaign focused on transparency, open communication, and defending public education from ongoing provincial defunding. I spoke out about the real challenges schools are facing — overcrowded classrooms, limited resources, and the lack of Indigenous cultural supports and mental health services. I advocated for practical, compassionate solutions rooted in lived experience, and worked to amplify the voices of teachers, parents, students, and community members. My campaign was independent and community-driven, grounded in a deep commitment to inclusive, equitable education for all.</p>

        <p>The Writer Team is a one-shot, multi-agent AI editorial system I built to simulate the workflow of a full writing and editing team. Each agent has a defined role—some interpret the user’s intent, others build structure, draft content, refine tone, and apply editorial QA. The system runs as a single-pass, chained process using asynchronous Python and tiered prompt injection, with each agent building on the context of those before it. Designed to turn even the vaguest input into a complete, polished document, it blends creativity with rigorous quality control, all in one streamlined generation.</p>
